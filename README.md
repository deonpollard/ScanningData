# Welcome!
Welcome to the ScanningData GitHub Repository! This Repository contains sets of scripts essential for data scanning in support of the [Capiible Platform](http://www.senya.co.uk/capiible.html), although it could be use completely stand-alone.  Early days for the Repository.
# Scanning the following Data
## Structured Data
Structured data usually resides in relational databases (RDBMS). Fields store length-delineated data phone numbers, Social Security numbers, or ZIP codes. Even text strings of variable length like names are contained in records, making it a simple matter to search.
## UnStructured Data
Unstructured data has internal structure but is not structured via pre-defined data models or schema. It may be textual or non-textual, and human- or machine-generated. It may also be stored within a non-relational database like NoSQL. Typically includes:
* Text files: Word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, email, logs.
* Email: Email has some internal structure thanks to its metadata, and we sometimes refer to it as semi-structured. However, its message field is unstructured and traditional analytics tools cannot parse it.
* Social Media: Data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.
* Website: YouTube, Instagram, photo sharing sites.
* Mobile data: Text messages, locations.
* Communications: Chat, IM, phone recordings, collaboration software.
* Media: MP3, digital photos, audio and video files.
* Business applications: MS Office documents, productivity applications.
* Typical machine-generated unstructured data includes:
* Satellite imagery: Weather data, land forms, military movements.
* Scientific data: Oil and gas exploration, space exploration, seismic imagery, atmospheric data.
* Digital surveillance: Surveillance photos and video.
* Sensor data: Traffic, weather, oceanographic sensors.
## Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data maintains internal tags and markings that identify separate data elements, which enables information grouping and hierarchies. Amongst others includes:
* Markup language XML This is a semi-structured document language. 
* Open standard JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) JSON is another semi-structured data interchange format. 
## Other Data
Loosely grouped for now.
* 3RD Party Data
* Cloud Data
* Big Data
